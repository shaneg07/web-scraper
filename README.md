# web-scraper
Built a web scraper in python.
This particular script uses scrapy to scrape off the sports products section's item names from a French e-commerce website https://www.e.leclerc/ . Other details can be scraped as well by
having a look at the JSON format that is returned by the website and storing those particular "labels".

A concise preview of the scrpers results :
